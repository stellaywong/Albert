One man against the authorities.\n Or one man against a city of zombies. One man\n  \n Who is not, in fact, a man, sent to understand\n The caravan of men now chasing him like red ants\n Let loose down the pants of America. Man on the run.\n  \n Man with a ship to catch, a payload to drop,\n This message going out to all of space. . . . Though\n Maybe it’s more like life below the sea: silent,\n  \n Buoyant, bizarrely benign. Relics\n Of an outmoded design. Some like to imagine\n A cosmic mother watching through a spray of stars,\n  \n Mouthing yes, yes as we toddle toward the light,\n Biting her lip if we teeter at some ledge. Longing\n To sweep us to her breast, she hopes for the best\n  \n While the father storms through adjacent rooms\n Ranting with the force of Kingdom Come,\n Not caring anymore what might snap us in its jaw.\n  \n Sometimes,  what I see is a library in a rural community.\n All the tall shelves in the big open room. And the pencils\n In a cup at Circulation, gnawed on by the entire population.\n  \n The books have lived here all along, belonging\n For weeks at a time to one or another in the brief sequence\n Of family names, speaking (at night mostly) to a face,\n  \n A pair of eyes. The most remarkable lies.\n  \n  \n           2.\n  \n Charlton Heston is waiting to be let in. He asked once politely.\n A second time with force from the diaphragm. The third time,\n He did it like Moses: arms raised high, face an apocryphal white.\n  \n Shirt crisp, suit trim, he stoops a little coming in,\n Then grows tall. He scans the room. He stands until I gesture,\n Then he sits. Birds commence their evening chatter. Someone fires\n  \n Charcoals out below. He’ll take a whiskey if I have it. Water if I don’t.\n I ask him to start from the beginning, but he goes only halfway back.\n That was the future once, he says. Before the world went upside down.\n  \n Hero, survivor, God’s right hand man, I know he sees the blank\n Surface of the moon where I see a language built from brick and bone.\n He sits straight in his seat, takes a long, slow high-thespian breath,\n  \n Then lets it go. For all I know, I was the last true man on this earth. And:\n May I smoke? The voices outside soften. Planes jet past heading off or back.\n Someone cries that she does not want to go to bed. Footsteps overhead.\n  \n A fountain in the neighbor’s yard babbles to itself, and the night air\n Lifts the sound indoors. It was another time, he says, picking up again.\n We were pioneers. Will you fight to stay alive here, riding the earth\n  \n Toward God-knows-where? I think of Atlantis buried under ice, gone\n One day from sight, the shore from which it rose now glacial and stark.\n Our eyes adjust to the dark.\n  \n  \n           3.\n  \n Perhaps the great error is believing we’re alone,\n  \n That the others have come and gone—a momentary blip—\n  \n When all along, space might be choc-full of traffic,\n  \n Bursting at the seams with energy we neither feel\n  \n Nor see, flush against us, living, dying, deciding,\n  \n Setting solid feet down on planets everywhere,\n  \n Bowing to the great stars that command, pitching stones\n  \n At whatever are their moons. They live wondering\n  \n If they are the only ones, knowing only the wish to know,\n  \n And the great black distance they—we—flicker in.\n  \n  \n Maybe the dead know, their eyes widening at last,\n  \n Seeing the high beams of a million galaxies flick on\n  \n At twilight. Hearing the engines flare, the horns\n  \n Not letting up, the frenzy of being. I want to be\n  \n One notch below bedlam, like a radio without a dial.\n  \n Wide open, so everything floods in at once.\n  \n And sealed tight, so nothing escapes. Not even time,\n  \n Which should curl in on itself and loop around like smoke.\n  \n So that I might be sitting now beside my father\n  \n As he raises a lit match to the bowl of his pipe\n  \n For the first time in the winter of 1959.\n  \n              3.  \n  \n In those last scenes of Kubrick’s 2001\n When Dave is whisked into the center of space,\n Which unfurls in an aurora of orgasmic light\n Before opening wide, like a jungle orchid\n For a love-struck bee, then goes liquid,\n Paint-in-water, and then gauze wafting out and off,\n Before, finally, the night tide, luminescent\n And vague, swirls in, and on and on. . . . \n  \n In those last scenes, as he floats\n Above Jupiter’s vast canyons and seas,\n Over the lava strewn plains and mountains\n Packed in ice, that whole time, he doesn’t blink.\n In his little ship, blind to what he rides, whisked\n Across the wide-screen of unparcelled time,\n Who knows what blazes through his mind?\n Is it still his life he moves through, or does\n That end at the end of what he can name?\n  \n On set, it’s shot after shot till Kubrick is happy,\n Then the costumes go back on their racks\n And the great gleaming set goes black.\n  \n  \n           5.\n  \n When my father worked on the Hubble Telescope, he said\n They operated like surgeons: scrubbed and sheathed\n In papery green, the room a clean cold, a bright white.\n  \n He’d read Larry Niven at home, and drink scotch on the rocks,\n His eyes exhausted and pink. These were the Reagan years,\n When we lived with our finger on The Button and struggled\n  \n To view our enemies as children. My father spent whole seasons\n Bowing before the oracle-eye, hungry for what it would find.\n His face lit-up whenever anyone asked, and his arms would rise\n  \n As if he were weightless, perfectly at ease in the never-ending\n Night of space. On the ground, we tied postcards to balloons\n For peace. Prince Charles married Lady Di. Rock Hudson died.\n  \n We learned new words for things. The decade changed.\n  \n The first few pictures came back blurred, and I felt ashamed\n For all the cheerful engineers, my father and his tribe. The second time,\n The optics jibed. We saw to the edge of all there is—\n  \n So brutal and alive it seemed to comprehend us back.", uploader_id: demouser.id)

El General \nsearches for a word; he is all the world \nthere is. Like a parrot imitating spring,\n\nwe lie down screaming as rain punches through \nand we come up green. We cannot speak an R—\nout of the swamp, the cane appears\n\nand then the mountain we call in whispers Katalina.\nThe children gnaw their teeth to arrowheads. \nThere is a parrot imitating spring.\n\nEl General has found his word: perejil.\nWho says it, lives. He laughs, teeth shining \nout of the swamp. The cane appears\n\nin our dreams, lashed by wind and streaming. \nAnd we lie down. For every drop of blood \nthere is a parrot imitating spring.\nOut of the swamp the cane appears.\n\n\n2. The Palace\n\nThe word the general’s chosen is parsley. \nIt is fall, when thoughts turn\nto love and death; the general thinks\nof his mother, how she died in the fall\nand he planted her walking cane at the grave \nand it flowered, each spring stolidly forming \nfour-star blossoms. The general\n\npulls on his boots, he stomps to\nher room in the palace, the one without \ncurtains, the one with a parrot\nin a brass ring. As he paces he wonders \nWho can I kill today. And for a moment \nthe little knot of screams\nis still. The parrot, who has traveled\n\nall the way from Australia in an ivory \ncage, is, coy as a widow, practising \nspring. Ever since the morning \nhis mother collapsed in the kitchen \nwhile baking skull-shaped candies \nfor the Day of the Dead, the general \nhas hated sweets. He orders pastries \nbrought up for the bird; they arrive\n\ndusted with sugar on a bed of lace. \nThe knot in his throat starts to twitch; \nhe sees his boots the first day in battle \nsplashed with mud and urine\nas a soldier falls at his feet amazed—\nhow stupid he looked!— at the sound\nof artillery. I never thought it would sing \nthe soldier said, and died. Now\n\nthe general sees the fields of sugar \ncane, lashed by rain and streaming. \nHe sees his mother’s smile, the teeth \ngnawed to arrowheads. He hears \nthe Haitians sing without R’s\nas they swing the great machetes: \nKatalina, they sing, Katalina,\n\nmi madle, mi amol en muelte. God knows \nhis mother was no stupid woman; she \ncould roll an R like a queen. Even \na parrot can roll an R! In the bare room \nthe bright feathers arch in a parody \nof greenery, as the last pale crumbs\ndisappear under the blackened tongue. Someone\n\ncalls out his name in a voice\nso like his mother’s, a startled tear\nsplashes the tip of his right boot.\nMy mother, my love in death. \nThe general remembers the tiny green sprigs \nmen of his village wore in their capes \nto honor the birth of a son. He will\norder many, this time, to be killed\n\nfor a single, beautiful word.", uploader_id: demouser.id)

Even\nafter we brought the attention\nof our knives to the neighbors of\nour neighbors, until at last\nthe neighborhoods fell silent\nand the cities quiet and the city’s\ncity, the country then and next\nthe country, until finally the moon,\nas if its own reflection, looked\nupon an earth that we had emptied\nnearly back to Eden. Even then,\nin a silence which seemed almost\na silence, sadly we were not\nalone. All we ever wanted was\nto be alone, to visit no one, to be\nvisited by nothing. But even after\nwe’d traveled to nearby planets\nand relieved them of their voices,\neven after—and we all knew\nthis was coming—we fell amongst\neach other, brother and sister,\nuntil only I survived, still I heard it,\nthe universe subtracted of its skin\nand hair, and yet the sound\nof a voice, like someone singing\nin the hold of a sinking ship,\nunbidden and irrelevant, a fathom\nand a fathom deep, but never fading\n", uploader_id: demouser.id)

The other\n a man's, who, I am told is deaf\n but vicious. He told me\n our father calls him long distance\n from America, every week.\n I can't help but wonder how\n they tell the roosters apart\n since the blood has turned their feathers\n the same shade of burgundy.\n I told him how our father, who lives\n only three mile away from me\n avoids making eye-contact at supermarkets.\n I can tell this made him happy.\n Though, he didn't cheer\n when the crowd cheered, when one rooster\n fell to the dirt with a gash in its neck\n I knew he was the winner\n the way he lowered his head to hide\n his smile, how he looked at me\n then snatched his earnings\n from the vicious man's hands.\n I learned what it was like to be a brother\n by watching the roosters\n & how, at first, the air was calm\n until they were introduced\n & then they knew:\n there could only be one.", uploader_id: demouser.id)
